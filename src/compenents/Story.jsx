              Pyroguard was founded in response to the growing concern around
              cyberbullying and cyber fraud, two increasingly prevalent issues
              in todayâ€™s digital world. Our founders saw the emotional and
              financial damage caused by both online abuse and fraudulent
              schemes. Driven by the need for a proactive solution, we developed
              a platform that addresses both problems, offering a comprehensive,
              easy-to-use solution that helps individuals safeguard their
              digital presence.
